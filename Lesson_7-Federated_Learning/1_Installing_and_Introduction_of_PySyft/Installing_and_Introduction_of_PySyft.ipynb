    "In order to perform Federated Learning, we need to be able to use Deep Learning techniques on remote machines. This will require a new set of tools. Specifically, we will use an extensin of PyTorch called PySyft.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install PySyft\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to install the required libraries is with [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/overview.html). Create a new environment, then install the dependencies in that environment. In your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create -n pysyft python=3\n",
    "conda activate pysyft # some older version of conda require \"source activate pysyft\" instead.\n",
    "conda install jupyter notebook\n",
    "pip install syft\n",
    "pip install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any errors relating to zstd - run the following (if everything above installed fine then skip this step):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall zstd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and then retry installing syft (pip install syft).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Windows, I suggest installing [Anaconda and using the Anaconda Prompt](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/) to work from the command line. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this environment activated and in the repo directory, launch Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and re-open this notebook on the new Jupyter server.\n",
    "\n",
    "If any part of this doesn't work for you (or any of the tests fail) - first check the [README](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft.git) for installation help and then open a Github Issue or ping the #beginner channel in our slack! [slack.openmined.org](http://slack.openmined.org/)"
